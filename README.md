geo-clone
=========

You'll need python and django installed (I used python 2.7 and django 1.3.1); that should be it.
To run, go to the main geocacher project directory and run
> python manage.py runserver

and the site will be up at localhost:8000. Explore a bit, create your own user
or login as jane, john, or matt (all should have password 'a').
